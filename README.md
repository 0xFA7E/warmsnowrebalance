# Warm Snow HP Rebalance Mod
Rebalancing Mod for Warm Snow

This mod adjusts the later difficulties(notably snowstorm and blizzrad(sic) ) to more sane values for HP. Blizzard is now a slightly beefed up heavy snow but the
later stage enemies are significantly toned down so HP bloat is a tad closer to a linear increase instead of the massive bump in vanilla with snowstorm difficulty being
slightly inbetween the two. Chosen values were because it sounded good, and feedback on finetuning is highly welcomed. Other rebalancing effects/mods may come if interest is raised. A detailed table of original values as well as changes can be found on the DataForNerds.md page

# Installing with Melon Loader

Melon Loader is a modding framework/manager for Unity Games and the HP rebalancing mod can be installed with it. To do so follow the instructions at 
https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation

The game folder location would be c:\\(path to your SteamLibrary)\steamapps\common\WarmSnow\

Once melonloader says it has succeeded, open up the game once so that melonloader can create the necessary folders. You will now see a Mods folder in the WarmSnow game folder
Copy the WarmSnowHPRebalance.dll file(which can be found in the releases section to the right) to this folder and then launch the game and enjoy! The WarmSnowHPRebalance.dll file can be downloaded
from the releases section to the right under the v1.0.0.0-melon section. 

The mod folder location would be c:\\(path to your SteamLibrary)\steamapps\common\WarmSnow\Mods\

# Vampire Survivor Mode

This is a variant of the HP rebalance mod that aggressively reduces HP bloats even more on blizzrad(sic) difficulty, being in the ballpark of slightly more than medium snow difficulty with the tradeoff in a substantial increase in the number of enemies spawned, an obvious reference to the game Vampire Survivors. This mode is still way easier than base blizzrad(sic) but also far more zanier. Its not meant to achieve a good balance like the regular HP rebalance mod aims to achieve but more for just some simple kooky fun and big numbers funny. There are two versions of this mode, one that increases enemy spawns by 20x and one that increases it by 10x. I personally prefer the 20x version but the game has some notable frame drops during the early part of a room till some patches of enemies get cleared out, while the 10x version played far more smoothly. Your mileage may vary. 

It can be installed the same way as the regular mod(and can be fetched from the releases section to the right with a zip folder containing both 20x and 10x versions),  however only have one of either the WarmSnowHPRebalance.dll , VampireSurvivormode20x.dll , or VampireSurvivormode10x.dll in your mods folder at any given time or else there may be issues. In the future I may look into merging them into one file with user settings to switch between the settings.
